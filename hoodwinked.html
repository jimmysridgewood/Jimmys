  <p> An investigative reporter habitually lies about his identity and intentions in order to
   gather information, implying that the end justifies the means. </p>
  <p>
   <em>I spend a lot of my time on the subway</em></p>
   <p>None, in the traditional sense. We learn that the evil plot involves cornering the market
   by creating increasingly addictive experiences.
  </p>
  <p><em>When the subway is broken I feel sick</em></p>

   <p>There are things we don't know about our grandmothers, in part because they haven't
   been completely honest with us.</p>
  <p> <em>When the subway has a disease in it's blood it's because i'm Sick</em></p>
  <p> An exclamation of "oh schnitzel."</p>
    <p><em> I don't even know who drives the subway and who tells them what to do.</em></p>
    <p>Our moments involve peril more than outright violence. An avalanche threatens people.
      A runaway nearly steamrolls the woodsman. In separate scenes all fall from great
      heights, but aren't badly hurt. Dynamite blows up a stretch of track, sending a mine car
      flying through the air with passengers inside. Blinded, a driver crashes his car into a
      tree, but announces that he isn't dead yet.</p>
